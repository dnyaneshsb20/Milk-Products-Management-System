## ðŸ“– About the Project

The **Milk Product Management System** is a desktop software developed for dairy shops to make their daily work faster and easier.

Previously, dairy shops maintained records in notebooks and registers to track customer details, milk quantity, inventory, and bills. This process was slow, error-prone, and difficult to manage.

With this software:
- Records are stored digitally on the computer  
- Bills are generated automatically  
- Data is easy to update  
- Customer/product info is quick to find  
- Saves time, effort, and paper
